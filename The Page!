		<h3>I'll start with my interests.</h>
		<p>I like reading and writing. I read mostly fantasy and president's memoirs. I write fantasy novels and very bad poetry.<p/>
		<p>I also enjoy reading the same news article from different sources and comparing them.</p> 
			<h2>I also really like Martial arts!</h>
		<p>I currently do Taekwondo. It focuses on complicated and deadly kicks.<p/>
      <br/>
			<p>I enjoy discussing politics and I LOVE election season. All the colored signs fill me with joy.</p>
      <p>:)</p>

    <This page probably gives you a sense of who I am (somewhat).</p>
